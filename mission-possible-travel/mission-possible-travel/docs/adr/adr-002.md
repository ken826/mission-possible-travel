# ADR-002: Unified Request Model with Typed Extensions

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

Travel and catering requests share a common lifecycle (request → approval → fulfilment → invoice → close) but require different data fields.

## Decision

Implement a single Request core entity with a requestType discriminator:

TRAVEL
CATERING

Type-specific data will be stored in extension tables (e.g. TravelDetails, CateringDetails) linked 1-to-1 with the parent request.

### Core Request Fields

Request ID
Requester
Cost centre / directorate
Business purpose
Status
Current owner
Submitted timestamp
Closed timestamp

## Consequences

### Positive

- One workflow engine
- Consistent approvals, audit, and reporting
- Simplifies UI and permissions

### Negative

- Requires careful form design to keep user experience simple
