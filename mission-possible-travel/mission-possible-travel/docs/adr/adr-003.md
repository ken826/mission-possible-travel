# ADR-003: Explicit Workflow State Machine with Ownership and SLAs

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

Currently, request progress is implicit and tracked mentally or via email chains, leading to stalled requests and unnecessary follow-ups.

## Decision

All requests will move through a strict, explicit state machine. Each state has:

- A clear owner
- Entry/exit timestamps
- Optional SLA timers

## Initial Workflow States

SUBMITTED
TRIAGE
AWAITING_APPROVAL
APPROVED
REJECTED
QUOTING
OPTION_REVIEW
BOOKED
ITINERARY_SENT
INVOICED
RECONCILED
CLOSED
CANCELLED

## Consequences

### Positive

- Immediate visibility into bottlenecks
- Enables reminders, escalation, and reporting
- Makes handover between staff seamless

### Negative

- Requires agreement on state definitions (expected to evolve)
