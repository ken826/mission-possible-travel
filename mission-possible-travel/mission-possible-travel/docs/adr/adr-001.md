# ADR-001: Build a Dedicated Travel & Catering Operations Application (“Mission: Possible”)

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09
Application Name: Mission: Possible

## Context

Travel and catering requests are currently initiated via a simple form, but all downstream activity (approvals, vendor coordination, negotiation, documentation, invoicing, and reconciliation) is handled manually via email, phone calls, and ad-hoc file storage. This creates high operational overhead, poor visibility, and dependency on individual knowledge.

The organisation has decided to fully remove reliance on monday.com for this workflow and replace it with a purpose-built web application.

## Decision

Build a dedicated internal web application (“Mission: Possible”) that becomes the single system of record and system of workflow for all travel and catering requests.

The application will:

- Handle request intake, approvals, fulfilment, documentation, and closure end-to-end
- Replace monday.com forms, boards, and file attachments entirely
- Provide structured collaboration between employees, operations staff, approvers, finance, and (optionally) external vendors

## Consequences

### Positive

- One authoritative source of truth
- Reduced manual chasing and email traffic
- Improved staff experience and operational resilience
- Enables automation, reporting, and auditability

### Negative

- Requires change management
- Initial build effort is higher than incremental monday.com improvements
