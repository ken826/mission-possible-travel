# ADR-005: Internal-First Design with Optional External Partner Access

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

External vendors (e.g. corporate travel providers) currently collaborate via email and phone. Direct system access could reduce friction but introduces security considerations.

## Decision

Design Mission: Possible with external partner access as a first-class architectural concept, but deliver it in phases:

- Phase 1: Internal users only
- Phase 2: Controlled partner portal access

External users will only ever see the requests they are explicitly invited to.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Future-proofs the platform
- Enables tighter collaboration over time

### Negative

- Adds complexity to permissions and support
