# ADR-011: UI/UX Design Principles and Branding

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-15

## Context

Mission: Possible serves a diverse user base:

- **Glenda** (70 years old, highly capable but values simplicity)
- **Amanda** (CEO's EA, needs efficiency)
- **Employees** (occasional users, need intuitive forms)
- **Executives** (time-poor, need quick approval actions)
- **Finance** (need clear data and exports)

The application must be accessible, calming, and efficient — reflecting MHFA Australia's mission around mental health.

## Decision

Adopt a "calm technology" design philosophy aligned with MHFA brand guidelines.

### Visual Design Principles

1. **Clean and Uncluttered**
   - Generous whitespace
   - Clear visual hierarchy
   - Minimal cognitive load

2. **Brand Alignment**
   - Primary colour: MHFA Dark Green `#00573D`
   - Secondary: MHFA Green `#00AA52`
   - Accent: MHFA Light Green `#B2D136` (sparingly)
   - See brand colour palette for full reference

3. **Accessibility First**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance minimum
   - Sufficient colour contrast ratios
   - Clear focus states for keyboard navigation
   - Readable font sizes (minimum 16px base)

### Interaction Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Show essential information first
   - Details available on demand
   - Avoid overwhelming users with options

2. **Clear Status Visibility**
   - Prominent status chips with intuitive colours
   - Timeline as the source of narrative truth
   - Clear indication of "what's next"

3. **Efficient Actions**
   - Approval in under 30 seconds from inbox
   - One-click common actions where safe
   - Keyboard shortcuts for power users (phase 2)

4. **Forgiving Design**
   - Confirmation for destructive actions
   - Clear undo options where possible
   - Helpful error messages with guidance

### Component Patterns

- **Cards** for request summaries
- **Tables** for list views with filtering/sorting
- **Timelines** for request history
- **Modal dialogs** for focused actions
- **Toast notifications** for confirmations

## Consequences

### Positive

- Application feels welcoming and professional
- Reduced training burden
- Aligns with MHFA's mission and values
- Accessible to users of all technical abilities

### Negative

- Requires investment in design polish
- May need user testing to validate assumptions
