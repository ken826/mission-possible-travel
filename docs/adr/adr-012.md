# ADR-012: Emergency Support and Out-of-Band Handling

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-15

## Context

Travel operations occasionally require urgent, out-of-band interventions that cannot wait for standard workflows:

- An employee is stranded at an airport
- Last-minute flight changes due to weather or cancellations
- Medical emergencies during travel
- Urgent venue changes for catering events

Currently, Glenda relies on an emergency hotline with Flight Centre Corporate Travel (FCCT) for these situations. The application must support, not hinder, these critical scenarios.

## Decision

Design Mission: Possible to **complement** emergency procedures rather than replace them.

### Emergency Handling Strategy

1. **Surface Emergency Contact Information**
   - FCCT emergency hotline prominently displayed in app
   - Quick-access emergency contact for each active travel request
   - 24/7 contact visible in itinerary emails and documents

2. **Expedited Request Actions**
   - "Mark as Urgent" flag for high-priority requests
   - Urgent requests highlighted in all dashboards
   - Optional SMS notifications for urgent status changes (phase 2)

3. **Post-Incident Documentation**
   - Ops can log emergency actions in timeline after the fact
   - "Emergency Change" event type for audit trail
   - Capture reason, actions taken, and resolution

4. **Out-of-Band Booking Support**
   - Allow Ops to record bookings made outside normal workflow
   - Attach externally-received itineraries and invoices
   - Maintain single source of truth even for emergency bookings

### What the App Does NOT Do

- Does not replace phone/SMS for true emergencies
- Does not create barriers to immediate action
- Does not require approvals for emergency changes (logged after)

## Consequences

### Positive

- Emergency support remains fast and human-centric
- Maintains audit trail and documentation
- Reduces stress — the app is a helper, not a blocker

### Negative

- Some emergency actions bypass standard workflow (by design)
- Requires trust in Ops team to document after the fact
