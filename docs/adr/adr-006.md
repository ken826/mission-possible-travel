# ADR-006: Request Timeline as the Primary Communication Record

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

Email threads and phone calls fragment the historical record and make it difficult to reconstruct decisions.

## Decision

Each request will include a chronological, immutable timeline that records:

- Status changes
- Approvals and rejections
- Quotes received
- Option selections
- Bookings and changes
- Notes and comments

## Note Visibility Levels

- Internal (ops-only)
- Requester-visible
- Partner-visible (phase 2)

## Consequences

### Positive

- One shared narrative per request
- Reduces knowledge silos
- Simplifies audits and handovers

### Negative

- Requires behavioural change (“log it or it didn’t happen”)
