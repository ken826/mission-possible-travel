# ADR-004: Policy-Driven Approval Routing with Delegation

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

Approval routing is currently manual, varies by circumstance, and breaks down when approvers are on leave.

## Decision

Implement a policy-driven approval engine that determines approvers based on:

- Directorate / cost centre
- Total estimated cost
- Number of travellers
- Travel type (e.g. international, group)
- Recent cumulative spend (phase 2)

## Features

- Primary approver assignment
- CEO escalation rules
- Acting approver delegation with date ranges
- Ops override for exceptional circumstances

## Consequences

### Positive

- Eliminates approval ambiguity
- Reduces operational chasing
- Provides a clean audit trail

### Negative

- Requires initial policy configuration
