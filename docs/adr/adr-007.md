# ADR-007: Notification Strategy with App as Source of Truth

Status: Accepted
Date: 2026-01-09

## Context

Staff rely on email for action prompts, but email must not become the system of record.

## Decision

Mission: Possible will:

- Send notifications (email initially; other channels later)
- Always link back to the request in-app
- Allow role-based notification preferences

Notifications will never contain authoritative state — only prompts to act.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Keeps users engaged without duplicating data
- Reduces inbox noise over time

### Negative

- Requires careful default settings
